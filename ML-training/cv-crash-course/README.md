# Computer Vision and ML crash course
The purpose of this example is the learn the practical foundations of computer vision and machine learning in Python. Having a high level understanding of data preprocessing, training and model inference is a prerequisite for the other exercises.

The file `digit_classification_sklearn.ipynb` contains a `Google Colab` notebook with the code needed for training a simple ML model on a digit classification dataset. It also contains the code needed to perform inference on your own images.

Watch the 5 videos and follow along with the examples to implement your own version of the code. Use the code file as a reference if you get stuck.
